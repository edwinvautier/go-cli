A CLI to initialize and work on go projects, mainly designed for API's.

## Install

>ðŸ’¡ You need to have go installed correctly on your machine.

Install the CLI by running :

```sh
go get github.com/edwinvautier/go-cli
```

Then you should be able to do :

![run go-cli in shell](assets/go-cli.gif)

## Initialize a project

You can initialize a project in your working directory by running the `create` command.

```sh
go-cli create
# or with app name
go-cli create my-app-name
```

The CLI will eventually ask you your **git username**, the **DB management system** you'd like to use and if you want to **dockerize** the application or not.

## Release Action

> File: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

Used to create a new release with 2 inputs:
- branch
- release tag

The used GitHub Action works with 2 steps:
- go build + go test
- generate release with :
  - release name
  - tag name
  - body containing changelogs
