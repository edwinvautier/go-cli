A CLI to initialize and work on go projects, mainly designed for API's.

## Install CLI

>ðŸ’¡ You need to have go installed correctly on your machine. More informations are available in the wiki.

Install the CLI by running :

```sh
go get github.com/edwinvautier/go-cli
```

Run `go-cli -h` in order to know more about commands.

## Initialize a project

You can initialize a project in your working directory by running the `create` command.

```sh
go-cli create
# or with app name
go-cli create my-app-name
```

The CLI will eventually ask you your **git username**, the **DB management system** you'd like to use and if you want to **dockerize** the application or not.

## Install a bundle

You can install bundles by using the install command of the CLI.
This command will look for a bundle located inside the bundles folder of the repository and install it.

```sh
go-cli install authenticator
```

### Bundle API

Each bundle should have the following elements :

- `templates` folder
- `install.sh` script
- `README.md` file to explain how bundle works and how to use it

The templates part must follow the same filetree as the project that is created.

## Make new model

With **go-cli**, you can use the `make model` command. It will create a new model and repository file with fields of your choice !

```sh
go-cli make model modelYouWant
```

## Make CRUD

**go-cli** can generate your controllers, to do so, you just have to use the `make crud` command :

```sh
go-cli make crud entityName
```

**go-cli** will eventually asks you to run the `go-cli update` command, that reads the models files, and parse their fields to the config.
