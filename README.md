A CLI to initialize and work on go projects, mainly designed for API's. 

It allows you to auto init your project with a docker configuration, generate your own model files, controllers, fixtures...

## Install CLI

>ðŸ’¡ You need to have go installed correctly on your machine. More informations are available in the wiki.

Install the CLI by running :

```sh
go get github.com/edwinvautier/go-gadgeto
```

Run `go-gadgeto -h` in order to know more about commands.

## Initialize a project

You can initialize a project in your working directory by running the `create` command.

```sh
go-gadgeto create
# or with app name
go-gadgeto create my-app-name
```

The CLI will eventually ask you your **git username**, the **DB management system** you'd like to use and if you want to **dockerize** the application or not.

## Install a bundle

You can install bundles by using the install command of the CLI.
This command will look for a bundle located inside the bundles folder of the repository and install it.

```sh
go-gadgeto install authenticator
```

### Bundle API

Each bundle should have the following elements :

- `templates` folder
- `install.sh` script
- `README.md` file to explain how bundle works and how to use it

The templates part must follow the same filetree as the project that is created.

## Make command

The make command generates files with automatic recognition of your fields.

### Make new model

With **go-gadgeto**, you can use the `make model` command. It will create a new model and repository file with fields of your choice !

```sh
go-gadgeto make model modelYouWant
```

---

### Make CRUD

**go-gadgeto** can generate your controllers, to do so, you just have to use the `make crud` command :

```sh
go-gadgeto make crud modelName
```

**go-gadgeto** will eventually asks you to run the `go-gadgeto update` command, that reads the models files, and parse their fields to the config.

---

### Make fixtures

**go-gadgeto** can generate your fixtures, to do so, you just have to use the `make fixtures` command :

```sh
go-gadgeto make fixtures modelName
```

**go-gadgeto** will eventually asks you to run the `go-gadgeto update` command, that reads the models files, and parse their fields to the config.

---

### Make tests

> Only works with models files for the moment.

**go-gadgeto** can generate your tests, to do so, you just have to use the `make tests` command :

```sh
go-gadgeto make tests modelName
```

**go-gadgeto** will eventually asks you to run the `go-gadgeto update` command, that reads the models files, and parse their fields to the config.
