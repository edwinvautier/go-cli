A CLI to initialize and work on go projects, mainly designed for API's.

## Install CLI

>ðŸ’¡ You need to have go installed correctly on your machine.

Install the CLI by running :

```sh
go get github.com/edwinvautier/go-cli
```

Then you should be able to do :

![run go-cli in shell](assets/go-cli.gif)

## Initialize a project

You can initialize a project in your working directory by running the `create` command.

```sh
go-cli create
# or with app name
go-cli create my-app-name
```

The CLI will eventually ask you your **git username**, the **DB management system** you'd like to use and if you want to **dockerize** the application or not.

## Install a bundle

You can install bundles by using the install command of the CLI.
This command will look for a bundle located inside the bundles folder of the repository and install it.

## Make new entity

With **go-cli**, you can use the `make entity` command. It will create a new model and repository file with fields of your choice !

```sh
go-cli make entity entityYouWant
```

### Bundle API

Each bundle should have the following elements :

- `templates` folder
- `install.sh` script
- `README.md` file to explain how bundle works and how to use it

The templates part must follow the same filetree as the project that is created.
